# Laws of motion

## Overview

This simulates the gravitational attraction between multiple bodies. It runs entirely in the browser.

With the default settings it simulates the orbits of the inner planets, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, around the Sun. It is possible to modify the attributes of these planets (initial speed, direction, mass and location), as well as to introduce new objects.
